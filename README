F Language: Spanish

In most cases, the basic word order of Subject-Verb-Object is the same in both Spanish and English. For example, it's pretty trivial to translate from "Yo corrí una milla" to "I ran a mile". This can be done purely with a Spanish-English dictionary that has entries for different tenses (i.e., it has an entry for "Corrí -> ran"). However, this basic word order tends to be complicated in Spanish when the Subject is doing something to the Object. The act of a person running a mile doesn't actually affect the mile. Meanwhile, the act of eating a pizza does something to the pizza. The Spanish translation of "I ate a pizza" is "Yo me comí una pizza." The word "me", a pronoun, was inserted in between the Subject and the Verb. A slightly different example is "I killed a bear", which is translated to "Yo maté a un oso." The word "a", a preposition, was inserted in between the Verb and the Object. The rules for how to add these complements to verbs are complex. Since these complementary words are not actually present in a 1-to-1 translation to English, something needs to be done to identify them and remove the translated tokens (or not translate them altogether).

Additionally, there is a slightly different word order where there is a third player who's neither the Subject or the Object, like in the sentence "I gave him a gift." "I" is the subject and "a gift" is the object, but "him" is the recipient of the object. I'll call this order Subject-Verb-Recipient-Object. Translated to Spanish, this order is changed to Subject-Recipient-Verb-Object (i.e., "Yo le dí un regalo", where "le" means "for him").
 
Another complexity for translating Spanish to English is that Spanish often uses suffixes to add prepositional clauses to a verb that encompass the Recipient and/or Object from the above word order. For example, the word "damelo" adds the suffixes "me" and "lo" to "da." "Da" means "give", "me" means "to me", and lo means "it." Thus, "Damelo" means "Give it to me" (note that the order of suffixes doesn't even necessarily correlate to the order of the prepositional clauses).

Original Test Document (also located in gato.txt).

Había una vez un muchacho joven que vivía en la calle con su gato.
El muchacho era pobre, y llevaba puestas ropas haraposas.
El joven casi no tenía para comer, y lo único que se llevaba al estómago era lo que podía encontrar en la basura para su gato y para él.
Un día, el gato, que se daba cuenta de la pobreza extrema de su amo, cogió unas botas, un sombrero y una capa, los limpió hasta que parecieron nuevos y se los puso.
A continuación, el gato con botas se fue a cazar al campo, y cuando volvió con un jabalí a sus espaldas, se lo llevó al rey, y le dijo: "Excelentísimo señor, mi amo el marqués le regala este jabalí para que lo disfrute con su familia".
El rey le dio las gracias, y esa noche en el castillo del reino se cenó jabalí asado, a la salud del marqués.
Al día siguiente, el gato se volvió a poner las botas y volvió a cazar un jabalí para regalárselo al rey en nombre del marqués.
El gato con botas repitió durante una semana sus regalos al rey.
Un día, mientras el gato con botas y su amo estaban en el río bañando y lavándose, pasó la carroza del rey cerca del río. 
El gato con botas lo vio, y rápidamente le dijo a su amo que se quitara toda la ropa.

The output of Google Translate (also located in data/cat.txt):

There once was a young boy living in the street with his cat.
The boy was poor and ragged clothes he was wearing.
The young man was hardly eating, and all you had the stomach was what I could find in the trash for your cat and for him.
One day, the cat realized that extreme poverty of his master, picked up a pair of boots, a hat and a cape, cleaned them until they looked like new and put them on.
Then the cat went hunting boots to the field, and when he returned with a boar on his back, carried him to the king, and said, "Sir, my master, the Marquis gives this boar for your enjoyment with his family."
The king thanked him, and that night in the castle of the kingdom had dinner roast boar, health of the Marquis.
The next day, the cat was put back and returned the boots to hunt a wild boar to give it to the king on behalf of the Marquis.
Puss in Boots for a week repeated his gifts to the king.
One day, while Puss and his master were in the river bathing and washing, the king's carriage passed near the river.
Puss in Boots saw him, and quickly told his master to take off all your clothes.

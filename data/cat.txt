There once was a young boy living in the street with his cat.
The boy was poor and ragged clothes he was wearing.
The young man was hardly eating, and all you had the stomach was what I could find in the trash for your cat and for him.
One day, the cat realized that extreme poverty of his master, picked up a pair of boots, a hat and a cape, cleaned them until they looked like new and put them on.
Then the cat went hunting boots to the field, and when he returned with a boar on his back, carried him to the king, and said, "Sir, my master, the Marquis gives this boar for your enjoyment with his family."
The king thanked him, and that night in the castle of the kingdom had dinner roast boar, health of the Marquis.
The next day, the cat was put back and returned the boots to hunt a wild boar to give it to the king on behalf of the Marquis.
Puss in Boots for a week repeated his gifts to the king.
One day, while Puss and his master were in the river bathing and washing, the king's carriage passed near the river.
Puss in Boots saw him, and quickly told his master to take off all your clothes.
